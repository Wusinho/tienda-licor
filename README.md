# Online Store - bsale

# Objectives

Build an online store that displays products grouped by category, generating separately backend (REST API) and frontend and using the database that is available to its development.

In addition, you have to add a search engine, which has to be implemented at the server, through an API Rest whose language and framework can be free choice.

The front-end must be developed with vanilla javascript without any framework, the use of libraries, components
specific, such as; bootstrap, material, Jquery, among others are allowed.

Finally, make the application and the repository available with the code and the hosting.
